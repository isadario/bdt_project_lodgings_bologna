# bdt_project_lodgings_bologna
This repo contains a project for a Big Data Technology University course.  It aims to analyse offer of lodgings in Bologna, cluster them and make suggestions to a potential host.  

The notebok can be accessed here in the Binder version

To interact with the notebook as dashboard it needs to be downloaded and the environment activated so to have the Voila button to activate the view  (should have been deployed on Binder - tried also with Heroku - but I kept on stumbling on issues with the nbextension/nbconfigurator). 
Here below the gifs display how it can be viewed:
