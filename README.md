# bdt_project_lodgings_bologna

This repo contains a project for a Big Data Technology University course.  It aims to analyse offer of lodgings in Bologna, cluster them and make suggestions to a potential host.  

The notebok can be accessed here in its Binder version:

To interact with the notebook as dashboard it needs to be downloaded and the environment activated (activating the yml file or creating a new environment with the requirements.txt file) so to have the Voila button. 

Here below the GIFS display some of the results (though in much worse quality to respect size limits)
